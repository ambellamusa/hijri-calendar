        <p>
            This website has been created with the aim of reviving the Sunnah of using the Hijri calendar, which is deeply rooted in the Islamic tradition. 
            Many Muslims today have become accustomed to using the Gregorian calendar, often forgetting the importance of the Islamic calendar. 
            Here, we will highlight key Islamic months, dates, and events from the Prophetic Sunnah, allowing us to familiarize ourselves with significant moments from our history and strengthen our connection to Islamic times and dates.

                <div class="month-info" id="muharram-info">
                    <p>Muharram, meaning "forbidden," is one of the four sacred months in Islam, 
                        during which fighting and battles were historically prohibited. 
                        The month holds special significance with the 10th day, known as Ashura, 
                        which marks the day Allah saved Prophet Musa (Moses) and his people from Pharaoh. 
                        Fasting on this day is encouraged.</p>

                <div class="month-info" id="safar-info">
                    <p>The word Safar means "void" or "empty." 
                        Pre-Islamic Arabs named it thus because their homes would often be empty during this time as they left to gather food. 
                        Another account suggests the name relates to the aftermath of battles, 
                        when victorious tribes would loot their enemies' homes, leaving them empty.</p>

                <div class="month-info" id="rabi-awwal-info">
                    <p>Rabi' al-Awwal translates to "the first spring," and refers to a time when pastures would flourish for grazing. 
                        It is also the month in which the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was born. 
                        However, it is important to note that celebrating his birth was not done by the companions, 
                        as doing so is regarded as an innovation (bid’ah). The name reflects that people stayed settled, 
                        not traveling during this time.</p>

                        this month follows Rabi' al-Awwal. The name, "second spring," 
                        continues the theme of seasonal changes and pasture growth, 
                        signifying the end of the spring season.</p>

                    <p>Jumādá Al-Ūlá, or "the first of parched land," is thought to mark the pre-Islamic summer. 
                        The name Jumada may relate to either the dry, parched land or to the freezing of water, 
                        as this time of year can also be associated with cold. The word Jumada can be masculine or feminine, 
                        with both forms being used.</p>

                        Like Jumada al-Ula, it reflects the climatic conditions during this time, 
                        emphasizing the dry or frozen nature of the environment.</p>

                <div class="month-info" id="rajab-info">
                    <p>Rajab comes from the root meaning "to respect" or "venerate." 
                        It is another sacred month in which fighting was forbidden. 
                        Pre-Islamic Arabs would remove the heads of their spears to avoid combat. 
                        The name also implies "removal," reflecting this practice of ceasing hostilities.</p>

                <div class="month-info" id="shaban-info">
                    <p>The word Sha'ban means "scattered" or "dispersed," 
                        referring to the time when Arab tribes would disperse in search of water or to raid others. 
                        It is also seen as the month that lies between Rajab and Ramadan, reflecting its intermediary position. 
                        Some scholars say the name could refer to being "between" two significant months.</p>

                <div class="month-info" id="ramadan-info">
                    <p>Ramadan derives from the root word for "intense heat" or "burning," 
                        symbolizing the spiritual purification that occurs through fasting. 
                        Another meaning refers to the intense thirst of camels, drawing parallels to the self-restraint of Muslims during the month. 
                        Ramadan is the month of fasting and includes Laylat al-Qadr, the Night of Decree, one of the holiest nights in Islam.</p>

                    <p>Dhūl-Qa'dah The name Dhul-Qi'dah is derived from the word qu‘ood (to sit or rest). 
                        It is a sacred month in which fighting and traveling were traditionally halted. 
                        This time was used for rest and peace before the onset of Dhul-Hijjah, the month of pilgrimage.</p>
