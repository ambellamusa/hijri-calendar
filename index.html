        <p>
            This website has been created with the aim of reviving the Sunnah of using the Hijri calendar, which is deeply rooted in the Islamic tradition. 
            Many Muslims today have become accustomed to using the Gregorian calendar, often forgetting the importance of the Islamic calendar. 
            Here, we will highlight key Islamic months, dates, and events from the Prophetic Sunnah, allowing us to familiarize ourselves with significant moments from our history and strengthen our connection to Islamic times and dates.

                        It is also the month in which the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was born. 
                        However, it is important to note that celebrating his birth was not done by the companions, 
                        as doing so is regarded as an innovation (bid’ah). </p>

                        Another meaning refers to the intense thirst of camels, drawing parallels to the self-restraint of Muslims during the month. 
                        Ramadan is the month of fasting and includes Laylat al-Qadr, the Night of Decree, one of the holiest nights in Islam.</p>
